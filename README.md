Welcome on this collaborative web site!

Unfortunately, many things need to be fixed on this page.

Fortunately, we have specialists for this.

## Todos

* [ ] Many coders are missing. Every coder should have a page!
* [ ] Fix the title: it should be {POWER.CODERS}.
* [ ] The index page needs a nicer welcome message.
* [ ] Navigation is missing on the about page and the coders page.
* [ ] The menu is ugly! Items should be on one line and look pretty.
* [ ] The footer should be the same for home, about, and coders.
  Furthermore, it should contain some meaningful content.
